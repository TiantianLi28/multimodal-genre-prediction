In an age where digital music consumption is prevalent worldwide, the importance of music recommendation has grown exponentially, particularly for users to discover music that aligns with their tastes. However, with elements of globalized genres being used for production, it is difficult to pinpoint what exact genre tracks may be a part of.

Machine learning helps facilitate such identification, utilizing musical data such as the key of the song, the lyrics, and extracted audio features such as danceability ratio, to assist with the task. Genre Classification is a multi-class, supervised machine learning task in the interdisciplinary field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Common use cases of Genre Classification include music recommendation systems, automatic audio recognition, and music generation.

In this work, we curated data from multiple sources and merged into a dataset with 7,299 tracks, including the basic information (track name, artist, album name), lyrics, MIDI file, and genre of each track. Using this dataset, we show that simple machine learning models such as multi-layer perceptron and random forest trained with multi-modal data are able to achieve high performance in genre prediction task.
